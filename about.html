	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I’m the kind of person where passion rushes through my veins, no matter what it is that I do; from school work to extra hobbies that I pick up on the side of my busy life. When I’m not daydreaming about flavour combinations, colour schemes or future destinations to travel; you’ll find me working away in a kitchen cooking up meals for as many as 1200 people at one time. Other than working, and dreaming my days away; I also like to binge on Netflix (almost anything – I’m up for suggestions since I raced through ‘Jane the virgin’ and ‘Grace and Frankie’.</p>

<p>I’m not as lazy as I just made myself sound, in fact I get super stir crazy if I’m not outdoors at least once a day; my favourite outdoor activity is horseback riding, I’ve been riding almost half my life now (11 years). Usually just for fun and only occasionally now-a-days, although I will attend some home shows and compete against fellow lesson friends. I also love love LOVE the beach; if I have a day off and the sun is shining; you know where to find me. Walking is pretty cool too, whether it’s outside or around the mall (usually the mall…). I get overly competitive with my step count – don’t you just love how iPhones can now track your steps! But come winter time – don’t expect me to leave the comfort and warmth of my bed.</p>
