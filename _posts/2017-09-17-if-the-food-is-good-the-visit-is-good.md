You’re probably wondering where I’ve been… I’m home now, sadly  (bittersweet more or less I guess). BUT that doesn’t mean the blog about  Belgium or Netherlands gets left behind! That’s right; I’m still behind  on these blogs, but that’ll change by today or tomorrow. Getting back  to reality has been hard, especially with this jet lag (it’s been  hitting H-A-R-D) so leaving these two countries to write about now when  home will help me escape the fact that I have to go back to work soon.

We arrived in Brussels, Belgium by bus; a new transportation that we  hadn’t taken yet on the trip (I vote train over bus; but cost wise the  bus was better). Belgium was a great stay; not because of the gorgeous  architecture or the history built within each city but because we stayed  with family! (Thank you Ruth and Tom for hosting us for the weekend and  showing us around parts of Belgium… Antwerp was our favourite of  course.)

Tom told us there’s a saying in Belgium; “if the food wasn’t good, the  whole trip wasn’t good” … in other words Belgium people love their food  to another level (I think I must be slightly Belgium because I am  definitely at that level). The food was amazing; the home cooked and the  restaurant cuisine. The first night we were there we went to Brussels  to eat at ‘Taverne Du Passage’ and had ate enough to keep us filled for  the rest of our trip; entrées… main… dessert… wine… then after dinner, a  beer; we full until the next morning (which is new feeling for me,  since I’m always hungry… even after I eat).

Bruges was a “must see” on our list for Belgium (If you’ve ever seen the  movie ‘In Bruges’ you’ll understand why). It is considered real life  Disney Land for adults, a fairy tale if you will; and if you don’t  agree; enjoy this quote from Harry – a character from ‘In Bruges’, “It’s  a fairytale town, isn’t it? How’s a fairytale town not somebody’s  f**king thing? How can all those canals and bridges and cobbled streets  and those churches, all that beautiful f**king fairytale stuff, how can  that not be somebody’s f**king thing?”. Being in Bruges walking the  streets, you felt like you were walking around the set of the movie with  all the canals, bridges and cobbled streets. Obviously it was a bit  more commercialized and touristy than the movie; but hit our  expectations almost perfectly. It even had rows of windmills – the real  old ones, not those white wind turbines you find all across North  America.

Belgium was a gorgeous country, never have I seen buildings with as much  detail as I did in Leuven or Bruges. If you ask me – it is a country to  defiantly check out and explore to learn about the history, or even  just to drool over the architecture (and gain a few pounds from the  delicious food). I would go back, not just to see my family but to  explore the half we didn’t get to see, since I’m sure those parts are  just as stunning as the rest.

Stick around for the next blog; which will be up tomorrow morning!

Caitlyn + James (Yup, we didn’t get sick of each other and are still hanging out after our trip).
