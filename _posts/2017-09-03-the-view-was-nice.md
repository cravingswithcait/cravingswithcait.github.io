Don’t expect the weather to be the same in any two places here over in  Europe… actually don’t expect the weather to be the same in the SAME  place over here. We’ve gone through almost every season within 5 days  (Thank god I over packed). Getting off the plane from Amsterdam to Nice  was a bit of a surprise when wearing pants and a jean jacket; the heat  was extreme. But of course having no where to change; James and I rocked  our black pants down the streets of Nice and onward to Cannes and got  weird stares as we headed to the beach fully clothed (some people were  even snapping some pics). We eventually made up for the heat with some  ‘Gelato’ at a corner stand on the beach – clearly we couldn’t wait until  Italy the next day.

After a long, tiring, HOT and breathtaking day in Cannes and Nice, we  headed to our Air B&B which had the most beautiful view of Nice; it  was one hell of a walk though (all uphill might I add- and James got us  lost once so it was uphill, downhill and Uphill again). Once we were  settled in and changed – because we were SWEATY – we headed back down  the mountain to find ourselves some food and ended up at a local grocery  store to bring back dinner to eat on the terrace with a gorgeous view  (we also purchased a bottle of wine for 3 euros which was pretty cool if  you ask me).

We didn’t stay in Nice overly long; maybe 30 hours… but it felt like a  long time considering the fast location changes we had previously the  days before. The morning before we headed to Italy was dedicated to  walking around the town (ya that’s right we’re hitting our 10,000 step  goal and exceeding it each day) and seeing what we had missed the night  before. We ran into a fish market and a vegetable market that I of  course dragged James through until we were both wheezy from the smell of  raw fish. I found out the hard way I don’t like rock beaches and James  found out the hard way that salt water stains everything (the waves are a  lot bigger on the coast of France than at Port Stanley or Grand Bend).

As many have said before; Nice is nice (I love puns) and I would go  back in a heart beat – mainly because I can get around with the little  Canadian French that I know and the beaches defiantly top South Western  Ontario beaches… except maybe the sand part. We’ve now been in Italy for  just over 2 days and are some how surviving the language barrier  (Italian is nothing like French and No one speaks English – no one). But  Italy is a different story.

Bon nuit, Caitlyn + James (he slept the whole time I wrote this  though so I don’t know if he really says good night to you guys or not)

(ps. I had to rewrite this like 3 times; I kept closing the app on my phone so sorry if it seems rushed at all!)
