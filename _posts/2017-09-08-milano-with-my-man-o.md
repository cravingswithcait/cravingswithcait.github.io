Milan was jaw-dropping gorgeous, from the train station to the  cathedral. If I made it seem like Iceland, Nice or other parts of Italy  were beautiful; multiply that by 6… at least. I don’t have much to say  about Milan since it was just a stop over before Switzerland; but those  18 hours were full of spectacular architecture and delicious food. The  views were amazing so I thought I would share some pictures.
