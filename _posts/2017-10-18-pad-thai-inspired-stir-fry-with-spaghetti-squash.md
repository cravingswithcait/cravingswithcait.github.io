The number one question I get when someone finds out I  cook for a living is, “What’s your favourite thing to cook?” usually I  hesitate but the answer always ends up being Pad Thai or Stir Fry. Its  true; I just love the way you can start with a pile of vegetables and  various flavours and end up with a delicious comfort food. No matter how  many times its made at work or at home; if there are leftovers its  devoured within seconds.

I decided to whip up a quick Pad Thai inspired Stir Fry the other day  for dinner (the flavour of Pad Thai, but really just a Stir Fry);  instead of rice noodles or a bed of rice, I placed it on a seasoned  portion of spaghetti squash. I’m not the type of person to tell you that  spaghetti squash is an awesome revelation and it’s replaceable for  spaghetti – because let’s be real; if you think that you are lying to  yourself. NOTHING will ever be able to replace a nice  starchy-carby-delicious bowl of spaghetti. But since I just happened to  have a spaghetti squash laying around, I decided I’d use what I had  (because who doesn’t just have a spaghetti squash laying around,  right?). That’s the great thing about stir fry, if you’re not too sure  about it – add it. It’ll most likely turn out one way or another.

For this recipe I used a selection of vegetables I had already,  spaghetti squash, chicken tenders and for the sauce I used a bottle of  ‘Pad Thai sauce’ – any variety will do, then added a few other flavours  that I had open in my fridge to make it more of a stir fry rather than  Pad Thai. The best thing about making this at work (or at home if this  is a needed dietary issue) is that it is gluten free and if you add tofu  in replace of the chicken; its also vegetarian. Being at home, I don’t  have an industrial sized fridge or storage, so I don’t have access to  any sauce of my choice – its whatever I have in the fridge or what I buy  while grocery shopping. But anything from leftover plum sauce packets  from a Chinese take out to an almost empty can of hoisin will do.

**If you need to make sure it is gluten-free, please check the  bottles of the sauces you’re adding before to make sure the ones that  you have do not contain gluten as the companies may be different**

Recipe: Yield 4-6 people

* 1 spaghetti squash
* 2 medium carrots
* 2 stocks of celery
* 1 Spanish onion
* 2 sweet bell peppers – any colour will do
* 1 clove garlic
* 1 pack of chicken tenders
* 1 bottle of Pad Thai sauce (12 oz)
* any other Asian inspired sauces laying around in your fridge

\-Start by cutting your spaghetti squash in half, removing the seeds  and lightly brush with oil and sprinkle salt and pepper. Lay the  spaghetti squash face up on a baking sheet with parchment paper and put  into the oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 40-50 minutes; make sure to  check on it and rotate it if necessary.

\-While your spaghetti squash is spaghet-a-fying; slice up your onion,  celery, peppers and carrots into a thin julienne. (thin long pieces)

\-Get your frying pan hot and add a little bit of oil – let the oil  heat up in the pan before adding any ingredients. Before cooking the  chicken, make sure you season it for extra flavour, I like to add salt,  pepper, basil and some garlic.

\-Cook chicken until done; then either remove chicken from pan or keep  going in the same pan; sauté the onion and garlic until the onion is  slightly translucent in colour, then throw in the carrot, peppers and  celery.

\-Once the veg is cooked (or at least 90%) add in the Pad Thai sauce.  This is also the time to find extra sauces to use up in your fridge. I  like adding soya sauce, sesame oil, hoisin and plum sauce. To spice it  up I’ll add Siracha and/or sweet chili sauce. There is no measurement,  just trust yourself and keep tasting until you get your desired flavour.

\-Now add in your chicken if you removed it from the pan earlier. Set  aside and keep on low. If you don’t find that the sauce is the  consistency that you’re looking for, add a bit of cornstarch mixed with  water to thicken it up.

\-By now your spaghetti squash should be ready; carefully take it out  of the oven and use a fork to pull the squash away from the peel into  spaghetti like strands and you’re ready to serve!

Replace chicken with Tofu if a vegetarian/vegan option is needed.
