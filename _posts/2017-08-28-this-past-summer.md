Fireworks perfectly describe this past summer for me; exciting,  eye-opening, celebratory, loud, sparkling, intense and fun. I could come  up with a million other adjectives but those seven can describe it for  now. I spent my summer away in Montreal, Quebec learning french (un  petit peu), and in Los Angeles, California visiting friends and soaking  up the sunshine. My summer has been extended due to friends getting  married over in Italy next week (Thanks a bunch Ana and Mitesh for giving James and I the perfect excuse to travel to Europe!) which means 2 and a half more weeks before I have to go back to work and deal with  the fact that I am now a working adult, and no longer a student. (Blah)

I feel like I should write a post solely on Montreal, my experience  leaving home for the first time and a little information on the program  that I attended – that can be my Saturday afternoon task I give myself  while I procrastinate packing my bags for Europe. Montreal was life  shaping and I am in love with the experience I had and the forever  friends I made.

Los Angeles was a shorter trip but my most cherished; I went to go visit  my BEST FRIENDS NEW BORN BABY; how exciting?! A miniature her. And even  cuter!! (Sorry Daniela). I’ve always had such a vision of LA, as I’m  sure many others have – the excitement of it, the energy, the fame – It  was my second time visiting, and it was just as good as the first. I  took my dad for his first time and showed him around all the popular  tourist attractions. Again; there will probably be a separate post about  it later on, but for now lets envy Chef Puck’s star for television on  the Walk of Fame.

For the next 2-3 weeks, I’m going to TRY to dedicate my spare time  while traveling to updating you guys – whomever may be following this  (Hi mom and dad – yes I’ll let you know I’m still alive and eating  well). As unrealistic as that sounds (and it probably is.. or at least  very difficult) I’ll need to do something on the train/plane rides from  country to country. Yes – that’s what I will do while James reads his  novels; perfect. If I don’t find the time to blog during my trip I will  defiantly have the inspiration to after the trip. I’m already drooling  over the food I am about to endure from [Stroopwafels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroopwafel)  in the Netherlands, to fresh made gnocchi in Italy… O.M.G – which may  help me direct this blog into what i hoped it to be from the beginning;  Culinary related. Maybe the next section in this blog after traveling  can make my culinary diploma come in useful outside of work and I can  try to replicate the delicious meals I had along the way – I think that  would be fun (and yummy x2). Maybe I can do that for all my future  travels; use it as inspiration… not that I have anything planned until  at least 2018, but ya never know!

Well thats about all I can think to write about for ‘my past summer’  (besides the separate blogs for Montreal and Los Angeles) so for now
