Thanksgiving preparation went as smoothly as it could go (especially  with the amount that was made), all baked goods had their final touches,  potatoes were peeled and soaking in water, bread was diced for stuffing  and set aside in the freezer until needed. It was the night before  Christmas – Just kidding, Thanksgiving; and our large family dinner was  all was under control. It was 9:45 on Saturday and I was calling it  quits in the kitchen after a few hours of fun. Then my phone lit up and  it was my uncle letting me know his girlfriend is vegan – A vegan was  coming to thanksgiving dinner; a dinner that was specifically made to  accent the flavour of the turkey.

Fast forward to Sunday – (it was 10:30 a.m.), the oven was on preheat,  turkey was getting stuffed with various vegetables and rubbed with a  selection of fresh and dried herbs. Knives were chopping, pans sautéing,  parents yelling – usual pre holiday shindig in the kitchen. After realising everything was probably way ahead of schedule, the stressful  aura in the kitchen disappeared. I was alone with a cutting board and a  pot, wondering what to do for a vegan meal that would be filling, and  kept some of the fall flavours incorporated. After a few minutes of  staring aimlessly into the abyss; it came to me; a stuffed pepper,  exploding with some fall favourites.

I grabbed a knife and got to it – dicing onion, potato, sweet potato,  apple, and jalapeno. Once everything was prepped; I heated up my pan,  coated it lightly with olive oil and sautéed the onion and jalapeno  until soft and the onion was translucent in colour. After adding the  potatoes and apple and letting it sweat out a tad; I measured a cup of  quinoa and vegetable stock, brought it to a boil and let it rest on low  until all the water had been absorbed. During the whole process I  seasoned as I went, adding a majority of the same type of herbs that  were included in the turkey rub – such as sage and oregano, salt and  pepper.

After the quinoa was just about cooked, a can of black beans and fresh  diced tomatoes were added; avocados were then diced and folded into the  mixture before being put into the gutted green peppers. On a baking  sheet, I had 4 peppers (tops cut off, and all seeds gutted), I lightly  oiled the peppers and seasoned them with salt and pepper before adding  the filling into them, the peppers were quite large so it was about  15-20 minutes before they were cooked to a consistency that I was  looking for. Since I had made the filling in advance I had to also make  sure that the filling was warm before taking them out of the oven, to  make it faster; the green peppers could cook at the same time as the  filling is being finished so both are cooked and hot and ready to serve  right away.

Here is a rough estimate on how much of each ingredient I used:

* 1 medium sweet potato – diced
* 1/3 cup white potato – diced
* 1/3 cup gala apple – peeled and diced
* 1/4 cup onion – diced
* 1 Tablespoon jalapeno – minced
* 1 540 ml can black beans
* 1 540 ml can of diced tomatoes – juice strained
* 3 avocados – diced

Sautee onion and jalapeno on medium heat until onion is translucent  in colour, add both types of potato and apple and sweat out until  vegetables start to soften. Add preferred seasonings as you go. Once  vegetables are slightly softened, add quinoa and vegetable stock; bring  to a boil then let rest until water is absorbed. Mix the can of black  beans and diced tomatoes, fold in diced avocado. Season until satisfied  with flavour components.

The recipe turned out great for a last minute idea; fall inspired  vegan stuffed peppers. This recipe makes a ton; I was able to stuff 4  large green peppers and have leftover mixture that I used later in the  week for vegan tacos on Boston leaf lettuce. Alone is great as a quinoa  salad, or a side to the rest of the leftovers from Thanksgiving. If I  were to remake this, I would most likely change the quantity of the  apple in this recipe as I didn’t get enough of the flavour; I think I  would leave out the white potato and substitute for more gala apple, but  overall I was very happy with how this turned out; and my uncle’s  girlfriend loved it – as well as my uncle, and so did I, even 3 days  later, it tastes just as good.

If you were to make this for a family of 4 and didn’t want many  leftovers, I would suggest cutting the recipe in half, and if you do end  up trying this; I hope you enjoy and please share with me how it turned  out and if you liked it or not!
